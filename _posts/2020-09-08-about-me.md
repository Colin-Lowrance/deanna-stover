# My name is Deanna Stover . . .

. . . and I am an Assistant Professor of Digital Humanities at [Christopher Newport University](https://cnu.edu/people/deannastover/) in Newport News, Virginia. I specialize in Digital Humanities (DH), Victorian Literature, and Children's Literature. My work often deals with the intersection of these three topics, such as in [my digital edition of H.G. Wells's *Little Wars*](https://scholarlyediting.org/2017/editions/littlewars/intro.html) (1913).

I'm currently working on expanding this project to include a critical edition of Wells's *Floor Games* (1911). Both *Floor Games* and *Little Wars* are about play with toy soldiers, so I'm rethinking how **digital** editions can invite and even necessitate **physical** engagement. As part of this, I am working with a designer to create 3-D printable versions of the civilian miniatures Wells and his illustrator imagined in *Floor Games* for users to download and then print themselves.

I graduated with my PhD in English Literature and graduate certificates in Digital Humanities and Women's and Gender Studies from Texas A&M University in August 2020. My BA is from Arizona State University, where I majored in English Literature with a Classical Certificate in Latin. I am also a member of [Phi Beta Kappa](https://www.pbk.org/).
